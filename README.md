# cypress-demo

This repository contains a basic application demonstrating the approach to end-to-end (E2E) testing. Inside the Cypress/e2e folder, you will find files examples, forms and fundamentals which contain tests. The tests utilize the Page Object Model (POM) design, with classes imported from the 'pages' folder.

The repository includes an example of component testing in the Accordion.cy.js file.

# How to Run Tests:

Clone the repository using the command: git clone [repository_url]
Install the necessary dependencies: npm install
Start the development server: npm run dev
Install Cypress as a development dependency: npm install cypress --save-dev
Open Cypress with the command: npx cypress open

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
